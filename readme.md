# ðŸš€ Getting started

You can simply install care.nvim with your preferred plugin manager. There are
builtin sources for lsp and more coming soon.

Care is initialized automatically and lazy-loaded internally so there is no need
for lazy-loading nor calling setup.

You can find more detailed installation instructions on the website
[here](https://max397574.github.io/care.nvim/getting_started).

# ðŸ“† Planned features

-   More integrations with existing ecosystem (e.g. mini.icons and lspkind)
-   UI for configuration and overview e.g. over sources
-   Cmdline Completion (relatively low priority)

# Support
