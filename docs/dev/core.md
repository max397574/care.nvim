# Core

This module is for the core of care. Here everything comes together with the
most important things being the menu being opened and the completion triggered.
# `care.core`

# Methods

## New
`Core.new(): care.core`

See [care.core](/dev/core)

Use this function to create a new instance. It takes no arguments and should be
called only once when the plugin is first set up.

## Complete
`core:complete(reason: care.completionReason?, source_filter?: fun(name: string): boolean): nil`

This function starts the completion. It goes through all the sources, triggers
them (completion and sorting) and opens the menu with the result.
You can also add an optional filter to only complete certain sources.

## On Change
`core:on_change(): nil`

This function is invoked on every text change (by default, see
`completion_events` in config). It updates the context field and triggers
completion if the context changed.

## Block
`core:block(): fun(): nil`

The `block` method can be used to temporarily disable care. It returns a
function which is used to unblock it again. This is used for the `insert`
selection behavior where you don't want to get new completions when changing the
text.

## Setup
`core:setup(): nil`

The setup function is used to setup care so it will actually provide
autocompletion when typing by setting up an autocommand with the
`completion_events` from the configuration.

## Filter
`core:filter(): nil`

Filter currently visible menu. This is used when moving the cursor.
# Fields

## Context
`core.context care.context`

See [care.context](/dev/context)

This is used to store the current context. There is always a new one created in
`on_change` and compared to see if it changed.

## Menu
`core.menu care.menu`

See [care.menu](/dev/menu)

In this field a menu instance which is used in core is stored.

## Blocked
`core.blocked boolean`

This field is used by the [block()](#block) method. It just completely disables
autocompletion when set to true.

## Last Opened At
`core.last_opened_at integer`

This variable is used to determine where a new completion window was opened for
the last time. This is used to determine when to reopen the completion window.

## Completing
`core.completing boolean`

Boolean to indicate if care is currently completing. This is used to avoid
completing and sorting on the same keystroke.
