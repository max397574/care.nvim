--- This module contains lower level utilities for the presets and the preset components.
---@class care.preset_utils
--- This function can be used to get a function to label the entries with shortcuts as [described
--- here](/configuration_recipes#labels-and-shortcuts).
---@field label_entries fun(labels: string[]): fun(_,data: care.format_data): string
--- With this function you can get a color if the entry is a color and the hex color code is available in the
--- completion item.
---@field get_color fun(entry: care.entry): string?
--- This function allows to get a highlight group for a certain hex color code. This is useful because like that the
--- user doesn't have to constantly create new highlight groups to apply a hex value to a certain thing. The
--- highlight group will have the hex value as foreground color.
---@field get_highlight_for_hex fun(hex: string): string
--- With this function you can get the kind highlight group for a specific entry. The style can either be foreground
--- or blended.
---@field kind_highlight fun(entry: care.entry, style: "fg"|"blended"): string
--- Gets the label detail if provided by the language server.
--- This is equivalent to the `vim_item.menu` from nvim-cmp
---@field get_label_detail fun(entry: care.entry): string
